# 📊 **Renewable Energy Data Analysis**

In recent years, we have witnessed a revolution in the energy sector. The **climate crisis** and the need for **energy independence** have driven countries to invest more and more in renewable energy. The goal? To **reduce CO₂ emissions**, move away from fossil fuels, and **ensure a more sustainable future**.

Global agreements, such as the **Paris Agreement**, have marked a collective commitment to tackling global warming, setting ambitious targets for 2030 and 2050. But are these efforts truly transforming our energy system?

📉 - Are we significantly reducing CO₂ emissions?
💼 - Is the renewable energy sector creating more jobs?
⚡ - Are countries increasing their installed capacity of clean energy?

To answer these questions and better understand this energy transition, I analyzed data from the past two decades. Below, I present key insights that help us assess how far we have come toward a more sustainable future.


## 📌 **Objective**
This project aims to analyze publicly available renewable energy data to uncover key insights about employment in the sector, investments, and the types of renewable energy used by different countries. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2023, allowing for a structured analysis of trends over time.


## 📂 **Dataset Description**

Time Range: 2000 - 2023

Variables Included:
- **Country**: Name of the country
- **Year**: Year of the data record
- **Renewable Energy Jobs**: Number of jobs in the renewable energy sector
- **Investments (USD)**: Investment in renewable energy in USD
- **CO2 Emissions**: CO₂ emissions in metric tons

📥 **Source:** This dataset was obtained from Kaggle. You can access it here: [Global Renewable Energy and Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishvijay/global-renewable-energy-and-indicators-dataset/data).


## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
Jupyter Notebook 📓
Git/GitHub 


## 📂 **Key Research Questions**
🔍 Renewable Energy Sources and Capacity

- What types of renewable energy exist in each country?
- What is the average installed capacity per country?

💰 Investments in Renewable Energy
