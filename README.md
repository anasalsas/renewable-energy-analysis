# **Renewable Energy Data Analysis**

In recent years, we have witnessed a revolution in the energy sector. The climate crisis and the need for energy independence have driven countries to invest more and more in renewable energy. The goal? To **reduce CO‚ÇÇ emissions, transition away from fossil fuels, and secure a sustainable future**.

Global agreements, such as the **Paris Agreement** represent a collective commitment to fighting climate change, setting ambitious targets for **2030** and **2050**. But are these efforts truly transforming our energy system?

## **Key Questions We Need to Answer:**
 - Are we significantly reducing CO‚ÇÇ emissions?
 - Is the renewable energy sector creating more jobs?
 - Are countries increasing their installed capacity of clean energy?

To answer these questions and better understand this transition, I analyzed **renewable energy data from the past two decades**. Below, I share key insights that reveal how far we‚Äôve come and where we‚Äôre heading in the pursuit of a cleaner future.

## Main Conclusions:

Over the past two decades, the renewable energy sector has undergone significant transformations. But which countries are leading the way? And is the shift to clean energy really making an impact? Let‚Äôs break it down.

- Who has the highest installed capacity?
**India, France, and Germany top the list**, with installed capacities of **26 075.53 MW, 26 044.69 MW, and 25 667.94 MW, respectively**. These numbers reflect a strong commitment to scaling up renewable energy.
(**[see installed capacity visualization](#installed-capacity)**)

- Who is investing the most?
When it comes to financial commitment, **India leads with $5.27 billion in average annual investments**, closely followed by the USA with $5.24 billion. This raises an important question: is heavy investment directly linked to higher capacity and lower emissions?

- Where are the most jobs being created?
The transition to renewables is also reshaping the job market. The top three countries with **the highest average number of renewable energy jobs are Brazil (523 578), Australia (518 076), and Canada (515 524)** ‚Äî all with close figures, highlighting a global effort to create green employment opportunities.

Beyond just looking at jobs per country, I wanted to dive deeper‚Äîwhere exactly are these jobs being created? Are some types of renewable energy generating more employment than others? By analyzing the data, clear patterns emerged. In Brazil, most jobs are concentrated in geothermal, solar, and wind energy. Meanwhile, in Australia, the leading sectors for employment are geothermal, biomass, and hydro. And in Canada, the top three are wind, geothermal, and hydro. These insights help us understand not only which countries are investing in renewables but also which technologies are driving the green job market.

- Brasil: Geothermal (565,768), Solar (547,306), Wind (526,767)
- Austr√°lia: Geothermal (587,615), Biomass (519,512), Hydro (511,043)
- Canad√°: Wind (569,573), Geothermal (556,750), Hydro (515,506)


- Are CO‚ÇÇ emissions decreasing?
Interestingly, Australia records the highest average **CO‚ÇÇ emissions** (0.53 Mt), while **India has the lowest (0.45 Mt)**. Given that India is also the top investor and one of the leaders in installed capacity, this suggests that a strong push for renewables pays off in reducing emissions.

**So, does investing in renewables make a difference?**
Based on this data, the answer seems to be yes. Countries that heavily invest in clean energy are not only increasing their installed capacity but also managing to keep emissions lower. While challenges remain, the numbers suggest that transitioning to renewables is more than just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. 

- How is the proportion of energy from renewable energy calculated in this dataset?
The dataset shows that Australia has an average renewable energy proportion of 52.72%, Germany 51.16%, and France 50.89%.

- According to my analysis of this dataset, countries like France, Russia, and India have **strong wind resources**, with average wind speeds of 7.75, 7.71, and 7.61 m/s, respectively, making wind energy a major part of their renewable portfolios. In contrast, Brazil and Australia benefit from high **solar irradiance**, leading to a stronger focus on solar energy, with average values of 206.06 and 201.71 W/m¬≤, respectively.

## Next Steps

- Expand the dataset to include additional renewable energy indicators
- Compare regional vs. global trends in clean energy investments
- Interactive Dashboard - Create an interactive version using a data visualization tool to make data exploration easier
