# 📊 **Renewable Energy Data Analysis**

In recent years, we have witnessed a revolution in the energy sector. The climate crisis and the need for energy independence have driven countries to invest more and more in renewable energy. The goal? To **reduce CO₂ emissions, transition away from fossil fuels, and secure a sustainable future**.

Global agreements, such as the **Paris Agreement** represent a collective commitment to fighting climate change, setting ambitious targets for **2030** and **2050**. But are these efforts truly transforming our energy system?

## **Key Questions We Need to Answer:**
 - Are we significantly reducing CO₂ emissions?
 - Is the renewable energy sector creating more jobs?
 - Are countries increasing their installed capacity of clean energy?

To answer these questions and better understand this transition, I analyzed **renewable energy data from the past two decades**. Below, I share key insights that reveal how far we’ve come and where we’re heading in the pursuit of a cleaner future.


## 📌 **Objective**
This project aims to analyze **publicly available renewable energy data** to uncover  insights on:
- Employment in the renewable energy sector;
- Investiments in clean energy;
- Types of renewable energy used across different countries.

By studying data from 2000 to 2023, we can **track global trends** and evaluate the progress made toward sustainability goals.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**

- 📅 Time Range: 2000 - 2023

Key Variables:
- **Country**: Name of the country
- **Year**: Year of the data record
- **Renewable Energy Jobs**: Number of jobs in the renewable energy sector
- **Investments (USD)**: Investment in renewable energy in USD
- **CO2 Emissions**: CO₂ emissions in metric tons

📥 **Data Source:** This dataset was obtained from Kaggle. 
You can access it here: [Global Renewable Energy and Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishvijay/global-renewable-energy-and-indicators-dataset/data).
